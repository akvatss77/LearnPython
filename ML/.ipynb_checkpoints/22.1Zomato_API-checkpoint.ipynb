Ancient theme is a very unique idea and they had maintained it soo nicely. It is cafe and bar. They have rooftop sitting also and they also provide smoking area. I enjoyed this place with some great dishes and drinks.   For starters, I had chilly panner and dry manchurian, they are dam tasty. The price is worth according to the taste and quantity.   Then we had main course dal makhani and butter naan. The naan was crunchy and the dal makhani is awesome.     Last but not the least Drinks are important soo i ordered vergin mojito and mix fruit mojito which was very refreshing.     The thing i like most is music system which had maded my day more special.
